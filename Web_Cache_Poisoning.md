# Web Cache Poisoning


## Introduction
**Web Cache Poisoning (WCP)** means caching an unusual response and serving it to other users. There are mainly two types of attacks:

1. Caching with **XSS**
2. **DoS** by triggering an error page

To understand this properly, you need a good idea of how caching works â€” including cache keys and collisions, cache oracles, and cache busters. A clear explanation of these concepts is available here:

## How to Identify It

### 01. Identifying cache oracles

First, we need to check if a response is being cached and analyze its behavior (this involves identifying a **good cache oracle**).

Examples of cache oracles:
- `Age`
- `Cache-Status`

> Note: These oracles depend on the CDN.

The research paper **[Internetâ€™s Invisible Enemy: Detecting and Measuring Web Cache Poisoning in the Wild](https://www.jianjunchen.com/p/web-cache-posioning.CCS24.pdf)** lists various CDN cache oracle identification fields in **Table 06**:

### 02. Understanding Cache Keys

Next, understand which parts of the request are:
- **Keyed** (used in the cache key)
- **Unkeyed** (ignored by cache but can affect response)

Typically:
- `Host` and `Query String` â†’ **Keyed**
- Most headers â†’ **Unkeyed**

### Attack Concept

By keeping **cache key headers unchanged** and modifying **unkeyed headers**, an attacker might cause the cache to store an unusual or malicious response after the original cache expires.

To avoid affecting live users:
- Add a **unique query parameter** or
- Change part of a **cache key header field**

This way, the poisoned response wonâ€™t impact normal users.

## Security Risks

Saving a poisoned response can lead to two main risks:

1. **Reflected XSS Attacks**

2. **Caching Error Pages â†’ DoS Attacks**

## Tools to Help

To find **unkeyed headers** that can change the response:

- Use **Burp Suite Param Miner extension**
- Refer to **mostly reported headers** listed in:
